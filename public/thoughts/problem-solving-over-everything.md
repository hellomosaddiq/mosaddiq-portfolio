# Problem-solving > everything else in coding

*May 15, 2025*

People always ask me what I love most about coding. Is it the creativity? The ability to build things? The potential career opportunities? The cool factor of being a "programmer"?

None of those, actually.

What I love most about coding is the problem-solving. That moment when you're staring at a bug that makes no sense, or trying to implement a feature that seems impossible, and then suddenly – click – you see the solution.

It's better than any drug, I imagine.

I discovered this addiction two years ago when I was learning JavaScript from that textbook on my phone. I was trying to build a simple calculator, and I kept running into this weird issue where certain calculations would give me results like 0.30000000000000004 instead of 0.3.

For three days, I was obsessed with this problem. I would wake up thinking about it, go to sleep thinking about it. I tried different approaches, googled everything I could think of, even asked random people on forums.

Then, on the fourth day, I stumbled upon the concept of floating-point precision. Suddenly, everything made sense. The problem wasn't with my code – it was with how computers handle decimal numbers. And there were elegant ways to work around it.

The relief and satisfaction I felt in that moment was incredible. But more than that, I realized I had just experienced something profound: the joy of understanding.

That's what problem-solving in coding gives you – not just solutions, but understanding. Every bug you fix teaches you something new about how computers work, how languages behave, how systems interact.

It's different from problem-solving in other areas. When I'm struggling with a JEE math problem, there's often this feeling of "I should know this already." The problem exists to test whether I've memorized the right approach. But when I'm debugging code, it's pure exploration. I'm a detective following clues, and every clue teaches me something new.

Last month, I was working on this portfolio website, and I ran into an issue where my CSS animations were working perfectly on my phone but looked janky on my friend's laptop. Spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong.

Turns out, it was a hardware acceleration issue. Different devices handle CSS transforms differently, and I needed to add specific properties to ensure smooth animations across all devices. Something I had never even heard of before encountering this problem.

But here's the beautiful part: now I know about hardware acceleration. Now I understand how browsers optimize animations. Now I can write better code from the start. That one frustrating bug made me a better developer.

This is why I prefer coding to consuming tutorials or reading documentation. Tutorials show you the happy path – here's how to do X when everything goes according to plan. But real coding is about what happens when things don't go according to plan. When your API returns unexpected data. When your CSS breaks on mobile. When your JavaScript throws errors you've never seen before.

Those moments of confusion and frustration? They're not obstacles to learning – they're the learning itself.

I've noticed that my approach to problem-solving has evolved over the past two years. In the beginning, I would panic when something didn't work. I'd assume I was doing everything wrong and start over from scratch.

Now, I've learned to embrace the confusion. When I encounter a bug, my first thought isn't "Oh no, I messed up." It's "Interesting, what's happening here?"

I've developed a systematic approach:

First, I try to understand exactly what's happening. Not what I think should be happening, but what's actually happening. I console.log everything, I inspect elements, I trace through the code step by step.

Then, I form hypotheses. Maybe it's a timing issue. Maybe it's a scope problem. Maybe it's a browser compatibility thing. I don't just guess randomly – I think through the possible causes based on what I've observed.

Then, I test each hypothesis methodically. Change one thing at a time, see what happens, learn from the result.

This process has made me better at more than just coding. It's made me better at thinking. Better at breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces. Better at staying calm under pressure.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what being a scientist feels like. You observe something unexpected, you form theories about why it might be happening, you design experiments to test your theories, you learn from the results.

The difference is that in coding, you get immediate feedback. You don't have to wait months for experimental results. You change a line of code, refresh the page, and instantly see whether your hypothesis was correct.

This immediate feedback loop is addictive. It's like playing a video game where every level teaches you new skills that you can immediately apply to the next level.

And unlike JEE problems, which often have one "correct" approach, coding problems usually have multiple valid solutions. You can solve the same problem with different algorithms, different data structures, different design patterns. Each approach teaches you something different.

Sometimes the most elegant solution isn't the most obvious one. Sometimes you need to think creatively, to approach the problem from an unexpected angle. Sometimes the best solution is to realize that you're solving the wrong problem entirely.

This is why I can spend hours debugging without getting bored. Each bug is a puzzle, and I love puzzles. Each solution makes me a little bit smarter, a little bit more capable.

When I'm stressed about JEE prep, when math problems are frustrating me, when the pressure of second attempt gets overwhelming – I code. Not because it's easy, but because it's the right kind of difficult. It's difficult in a way that teaches me, that builds me up instead of wearing me down.

Problem-solving in coding doesn't just give you working software. It gives you confidence. It proves to you that you can figure things out, that you can learn new concepts, that you can overcome obstacles through persistence and creativity.

And in a world where so many things feel uncertain – will I crack JEE, will I get into a good college, will I have a successful career – coding gives me something I can control. I can always get better at problem-solving. I can always learn new technologies. I can always build new things.

That's a superpower worth developing.
