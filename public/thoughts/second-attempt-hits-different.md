# Second attempt hits different

*June 20, 2025*

There's something about the second attempt that changes everything. The first time around, you're naive. You think you know what JEE is about, you think you're prepared, you think the syllabus is just another set of chapters to get through.

Then reality hits.

I remember sitting in that exam hall last year, staring at the physics paper, and realizing I had no idea what I was doing. Not because I hadn't studied – I had. But because studying and actually understanding are two completely different things. The questions weren't just asking what I knew; they were asking me to think, to connect dots I didn't even know existed.

The months after that result were... rough. Everyone around me was moving forward – friends getting into colleges, starting their engineering journey, posting pictures of campus life. And here I was, back to square one. Back to the same books, the same formulas, the same dream that felt further away than ever.

But here's what I've learned in these past few months of my second attempt: failure teaches you things success never can.

This time, when I sit down to study physics, I don't just memorize the formula for projectile motion. I think about why the formula exists, what it represents, how it connects to everything else I've learned. When I'm solving a chemistry problem, I'm not just following steps – I'm understanding the logic behind each step.

The pressure is different too. It's not the excited nervousness of a first-timer. It's the quiet determination of someone who knows exactly what's at stake. Every morning when I wake up at 6 AM for my 7-8 hour class marathon, I'm not doing it because I have to. I'm doing it because I want to prove something – to myself, to everyone who believed in me, to everyone who didn't.

My friends from school sometimes ask me if I regret taking a drop year. "Aren't you wasting time?" they say. "You could have been in some college by now."

But I don't see it as wasting time. I see it as investing time. In myself, in my dream, in the person I want to become.

The thing about second attempts is that they strip away all the illusions. You can't lie to yourself anymore about how prepared you are. You can't pretend that "just getting through" the syllabus is enough. You have to face the truth: either you're willing to do whatever it takes, or you're not.

And I am.

Every night when I'm studying after 2 AM, when the world is quiet and it's just me and my books, I remind myself why I'm here. IIT Delhi isn't just a college for me – it's proof that a kid from Dhubri can dream big and make it happen. It's proof that second chances aren't consolation prizes; they're opportunities to get it right.

The fear is still there. The doubt creeps in sometimes, especially on days when math problems feel impossible or when I see my friends posting about their college experiences. But alongside that fear is something stronger: the knowledge that I've already survived the worst part – the failure, the disappointment, the starting over.

This time, I'm not just preparing for an exam. I'm preparing for the life I want to build. And that makes all the difference.
