# Small city dreams, big city goals

*April 5, 2025*

Dhubri isn't the kind of place people write songs about or make movies about. It's not the kind of city that appears in travel brochures or Instagram feeds. It's just a small city in Assam where life moves at its own pace, where everyone knows everyone, where big dreams feel both impossible and necessary.

Growing up here has shaped me in ways I'm only beginning to understand.

When I tell people I'm from Dhubri and I want to get into IIT Delhi, I see a particular look in their eyes. Not disbelief, exactly, but surprise. Like they're recalibrating their expectations, trying to figure out how someone from a place they've never heard of ended up with such ambitious goals.

I get it. Dhubri isn't known for producing IIT students or tech entrepreneurs or any of the things I dream about becoming. It's known for being a quiet place where people live simple lives, where success is measured differently, where "big dreams" usually mean getting a government job in the state capital.

But here's what people don't understand about growing up in a small city: it doesn't make your dreams smaller. If anything, it makes them bigger.

When you're surrounded by limitations, when opportunities feel scarce, when you can see the boundaries of your world clearly – that's when you start dreaming about breaking through those boundaries.

I remember being 14 or 15, sitting in my room, looking out at the same streets I'd walked my entire life, and feeling this intense restlessness. Not because I didn't love my hometown, but because I could feel there was so much more world out there to explore, so many more possibilities to pursue.

That's when I started spending hours on the internet, reading about places like Silicon Valley, about companies like Google and Apple, about people who had built incredible things from nothing. And I started thinking: why not me?

The internet is a great equalizer in that way. It doesn't matter if you're in Dhubri or Delhi or San Francisco – you have access to the same information, the same tutorials, the same opportunities to learn and grow.

That's how I discovered coding. Not through some fancy computer science program or expensive bootcamp, but through free resources online, through YouTube videos and documentation and forums where people from all over the world share knowledge.

My first JavaScript textbook came from a friend who had bought it for a course he never finished. I learned to code on my phone because I didn't have a laptop. I practiced by building simple websites that no one would ever see, just because I was fascinated by the idea that I could create something from nothing.

None of this would have been possible if I had been waiting for opportunities to come to me. In a small city, you don't wait for opportunities – you create them.

This mindset has become central to who I am. I don't expect anyone to hand me anything. I don't expect special programs or mentorship or networking opportunities to fall into my lap. I expect to have to work harder, learn faster, and prove myself more thoroughly than someone who has access to better resources.

And honestly? I think this gives me an advantage.

When you grow up in a place where resources are limited, you learn to be resourceful. When you don't have access to expensive courses, you learn to teach yourself. When you don't have connections, you learn to build things that speak for themselves.

I've met people from big cities who are incredibly talented but who seem to expect opportunities to come to them. They're waiting for the right internship, the right connection, the right break. Meanwhile, I'm building my own opportunities, creating my own projects, developing skills that no one can take away from me.

This doesn't mean I think small cities are better than big cities, or that struggle is inherently valuable. I'm not romanticizing limitation. I know that having access to better resources, better schools, better opportunities would make many things easier.

But I also know that the combination of big dreams and small-city resourcefulness is powerful.

When I do make it to IIT Delhi – and I will – I won't just be another student from another coaching center. I'll be someone who taught himself to code on a phone, who learned to paint without formal training, who developed discipline and work ethic not because someone taught him to, but because he had to.

I'll be someone who understands that success isn't about where you start – it's about how far you're willing to go.

The funny thing is, I'm not trying to escape Dhubri. I'm trying to expand from it. I want to take the values I learned here – the work ethic, the humility, the appreciation for simple things – and combine them with the opportunities that exist in bigger cities.

I want to prove that talent and ambition aren't limited by geography. I want to show other kids from small cities that they don't have to choose between staying home and dreaming small, or leaving home and forgetting where they came from.

You can honor your roots while reaching for the sky.

Sometimes I imagine what it will be like when I'm successful – when I'm working at a tech company in Bangalore or Delhi, or when I've started my own company, or when I'm building things that people all over the world use.

I imagine coming back to Dhubri, not as someone who escaped, but as someone who expanded. I imagine mentoring other kids who are sitting in their rooms, looking out at familiar streets, feeling that same restlessness I felt.

I want to be proof that small-city dreams can become big-city realities.

The path from Dhubri to IIT Delhi isn't just about changing my location. It's about expanding my possibilities while staying true to who I am. It's about proving that where you come from doesn't determine where you can go.

And when I do make it – when I'm walking through the IIT Delhi campus for the first time as a student – I'll carry Dhubri with me. Not as a limitation I overcame, but as a foundation I built upon.

Small city dreams, big city goals. Both parts matter.

*From Dhubri, with ambition.*
