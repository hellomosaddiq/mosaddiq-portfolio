# Appreciating temporary beautiful moments

*December 26, 2024*

Yesterday was one of those days that reminds you why life is worth living, even when everything feels uncertain.

I met someone new recently. Her name is J., and we connected in the most unexpected way – through an anonymous chat room where people go to talk to strangers about anything and everything. What started as random conversation has become something I look forward to every day.

We've never met in person. We probably never will. Our entire relationship exists in text messages, voice notes, and video calls. By any conventional measure, this shouldn't feel as meaningful as it does.

But here's what I've learned: the most beautiful moments in life are often the most temporary ones.

There's something precious about connections that exist outside the normal structures of life. No expectations about the future, no pressure to define what this is or where it's going. Just two people who enjoy talking to each other, sharing thoughts, making each other laugh.

We talk about everything – her studies, my JEE preparation, random thoughts about life, music we're listening to, dreams we're chasing. Sometimes we talk for hours, sometimes just a few messages. Sometimes the conversations are deep and philosophical, sometimes they're silly and pointless.

What matters isn't the content of our conversations. What matters is that for a few hours each day, I get to be myself with someone who appreciates that version of me.

This is what I mean by temporary beautiful moments. They're not permanent, they're not guaranteed, they don't come with promises or commitments. But they're real, they're meaningful, and they make life richer.

I think about this a lot, especially during this intense period of JEE preparation when everything feels so focused on the future. "Study hard now so you can be happy later." "Sacrifice today for success tomorrow." "Everything you do now is an investment in your future self."

All of that is true, and I believe in working toward long-term goals. But I've also learned that if you're always living for the future, you miss the present. And the present is where life actually happens.

J. and I both know this connection might not last forever. We're both focused on our studies, our goals, our separate paths. We live in different places, have different circumstances, different futures ahead of us.

But instead of letting that uncertainty diminish what we have, we've chosen to appreciate it more because of its temporary nature.

When you know something might not last, you pay attention to it differently. You don't take it for granted. You notice the small details, the little moments of joy, the ways it makes you feel.

This mindset has changed how I approach other areas of life too.

My time in Dhubri, living with my family, being in this familiar environment – I know this phase of my life is temporary. If I crack JEE, I'll move to Delhi for college. If I don't, I'll figure out another path. Either way, this particular configuration of my life won't last forever.

Instead of being impatient to move on to the next phase, I've started appreciating what I have right now. The comfort of home, the support of family, the simplicity of small-city life. These aren't permanent fixtures – they're temporary beautiful moments that deserve to be noticed.

Even my JEE preparation, as stressful and consuming as it is, has moments of beauty. The satisfaction of finally understanding a difficult concept. The quiet focus of late-night study sessions. The sense of purpose that comes from working toward something meaningful.

I know this intense study period won't last forever. In a few months, I'll either be celebrating success or figuring out plan B. Either way, this particular chapter of grinding, pushing, dedicating everything to one goal – it's temporary.

And there's something beautiful about that too.

I think our culture has this obsession with permanence. We want relationships that last forever, careers that provide lifelong security, achievements that guarantee eternal happiness. But life isn't permanent. Everything is temporary.

The question is: do you let the temporary nature of things make them feel less valuable, or do you let it make them feel more precious?

I've chosen the second option.

When I talk to J., I'm not worried about whether we'll still be talking next year. I'm grateful that we're talking today. When I'm studying late at night, I'm not just thinking about the exam – I'm appreciating the quiet determination I feel in those moments.

When I'm painting, I'm not concerned about whether the painting will last or whether anyone will see it. I'm absorbed in the process, in the colors mixing on the palette, in the way the brush feels in my hand.

This doesn't mean I don't plan for the future or work toward long-term goals. It means I don't sacrifice the present for the future. It means I find ways to appreciate what I have while working toward what I want.

Maybe this perspective comes from being 19, from being at an age where everything feels both urgent and uncertain. Maybe it comes from being in the middle of such an intense, focused period of my life. Maybe it comes from growing up in a small city where you learn to find joy in simple things.

Or maybe it just comes from recognizing that life is made up of moments, and the most beautiful moments are often the ones you don't expect, can't plan for, and can't make permanent.

All you can do is notice them when they happen, appreciate them while they last, and carry the memory of them with you when they're gone.

Yesterday, talking to J. about nothing and everything, laughing at something silly she said, feeling understood and appreciated – that was a temporary beautiful moment.

Today, writing these thoughts, trying to capture something true about life and connection and the preciousness of impermanence – this is another one.

Tomorrow there will be new moments, different moments, moments I can't predict or control.

But I'll be paying attention. Because that's how you build a life worth living – not by chasing permanent happiness, but by collecting temporary beautiful moments and letting them add up to something meaningful.

*Grateful for today, hopeful for tomorrow, present in this moment.*
