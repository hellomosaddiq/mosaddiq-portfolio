# Painting since 8, coding since 17, music since forever

*February 1, 2025*

I have three ways to escape reality, and they've shaped who I am more than any formal education or life experience.

Painting since I was 8. Coding since I was 17. Music since forever.

These aren't just hobbies for me. They're not things I do when I'm bored or when I have free time. They're essential parts of who I am, like breathing or thinking. They're how I process the world, how I express myself, how I find peace in chaos.

Each one serves a different purpose, fills a different need, takes me to a different place.

**Painting is where I go to feel.**

When I paint, I'm not trying to create something beautiful or impressive. I'm not thinking about technique or composition or whether anyone else will like what I'm making. I'm just translating emotions into colors, feelings into brushstrokes.

There's something about the physical act of painting – mixing colors on a palette, feeling the texture of paint on canvas, watching an image emerge from nothing – that connects me to a deeper part of myself. A part that doesn't worry about JEE scores or future plans or what other people think.

When I'm stressed about studies, when the pressure of second attempt gets overwhelming, when I feel like I'm drowning in expectations – I paint. And for those few hours, the world makes sense again. Not because painting solves my problems, but because it reminds me that there's more to life than problems.

Painting is my emotional reset button.

**Coding is where I go to think.**

While painting is about feeling, coding is about logic. It's about breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces, about finding elegant solutions, about building something functional from abstract ideas.

When I code, my brain works differently than it does in any other activity. I become hyper-focused, completely absorbed in the challenge of making something work. Hours pass without me noticing. The outside world disappears.

But it's not just about the technical challenge. Coding gives me a sense of control that I don't have in other areas of my life. I can't control whether I'll crack JEE, whether I'll get into IIT Delhi, whether my future will unfold the way I hope. But I can control my code. I can make it work exactly the way I want it to work.

When life feels uncertain, when I'm worried about things beyond my control – I code. And suddenly I'm reminded that I can build things, solve problems, create value. That I have skills that no one can take away from me.

Coding is my confidence builder.

**Music is where I go to exist.**

Music is different from painting and coding because I don't create it – I consume it. But that consumption is active, intentional, transformative.

Music is the soundtrack to everything I do. I listen to music while studying, while coding, while painting, while walking, while thinking. Different genres for different moods, different activities, different states of mind.

But more than that, music is how I connect with emotions I can't express any other way. When I'm happy, I find songs that amplify that happiness. When I'm sad, I find songs that understand that sadness. When I'm motivated, I find songs that fuel that motivation.

Music doesn't just accompany my emotions – it helps me understand them, process them, work through them.

When I discovered Seedhe Maut, it wasn't just about liking their sound. It was about finding artists who expressed thoughts and feelings I'd been carrying but couldn't articulate. Their lyrics about struggle, ambition, the grind of trying to make it – that resonated with something deep in my experience.

Music is my emotional translator.

**Together, they create my world.**

The beautiful thing is how these three forms of escape complement each other. They're not competing for my time or attention – they're working together to keep me balanced, grounded, sane.

When I'm feeling overwhelmed by emotions, I paint to process them, then listen to music to understand them, then code to remind myself that I can build solutions.

When I'm stuck on a coding problem, I might take a break to paint, letting my subconscious work on the problem while my conscious mind focuses on colors and shapes. Then I come back to the code with fresh perspective.

When I'm studying for JEE and my brain feels fried, I put on music that matches my energy level – sometimes calming, sometimes energizing – and suddenly the material becomes more manageable.

These three activities have taught me more about myself than any personality test or self-help book ever could.

From painting, I've learned that I need creative expression to stay emotionally healthy. That I process feelings through creation rather than conversation. That beauty and meaning can emerge from chaos if you're patient enough to let them.

From coding, I've learned that I love solving problems, that I work best when I can see immediate results from my efforts, that I have the persistence to work through frustration toward understanding.

From music, I've learned that I'm deeply affected by rhythm and melody, that I need emotional stimulation to stay engaged, that art can provide comfort and motivation in ways that nothing else can.

But most importantly, all three have taught me that I need escape. Not escape from responsibility or reality, but escape to a place where I can be fully myself, where I can recharge, where I can remember why life is worth living.

Some people find this in sports, some in reading, some in socializing. For me, it's painting, coding, and music. These are my sanctuaries, my safe spaces, my ways of staying connected to who I am underneath all the external pressures and expectations.

I don't know what my life will look like in five years, ten years, twenty years. I don't know if I'll crack JEE, if I'll become a successful engineer, if I'll achieve the goals I'm working toward.

But I know that whatever happens, I'll still paint when I need to feel, code when I need to think, and listen to music when I need to exist.

These three forms of escape aren't just hobbies. They're lifelines. And as long as I have them, I'll be okay.

*Creating my own world, one brushstroke, one line of code, one song at a time.*
