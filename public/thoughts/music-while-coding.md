# Music while coding: from emo rap to desi hip-hop

*March 5, 2025*

I can't code in silence. I've tried, but my brain just doesn't work that way.

Some people need complete quiet to focus. They find any background noise distracting, any rhythm disruptive to their thought process. But for me, the right music doesn't distract from coding – it enhances it.

It's like music creates this bubble around me where I can think more clearly, where the outside world fades away and it's just me, my code, and the rhythm that keeps my mind in flow state.

But here's the thing: not all music works for coding. It has to be the right kind of music, at the right volume, matching the right mood for what I'm trying to build.

When I'm working on something that requires deep concentration – debugging a complex issue, architecting a new feature, trying to understand someone else's code – I usually go for instrumental music. Lo-fi hip-hop, ambient electronic, sometimes even classical. Something with enough rhythm to keep my brain engaged but not so much complexity that it competes with my thoughts.

But when I'm in building mode – when I know exactly what I need to code and I just need to execute – that's when I bring out the heavy stuff. Emo rap, desi hip-hop, sometimes even EDM. Music with energy, with attitude, with lyrics that match the intensity of creation.

There's something about coding to aggressive music that makes me feel like I'm not just writing functions – I'm building something powerful, something that matters. The beat becomes the rhythm of my keystrokes, the energy of the music becomes the energy of my code.

I discovered this by accident. I was working on a particularly frustrating JavaScript problem late one night, getting nowhere with my usual lo-fi playlist. Out of frustration, I switched to some Seedhe Maut tracks I'd been listening to earlier.

Suddenly, everything clicked. The problem that had been confusing me for hours became clear. My fingers were flying across the keyboard, the solution unfolding naturally. It was like the music had unlocked a different part of my brain.

Since then, I've been experimenting with different genres for different types of coding tasks.

For front-end work – HTML, CSS, making things look good – I often go for something melodic. Maybe some R&B, some indie pop, something that matches the creative, visual nature of the work.

For back-end logic – algorithms, data structures, complex problem-solving – I prefer something with a strong, steady beat. Hip-hop works great for this. The rhythm helps me think through logical sequences, and the wordplay often mirrors the kind of creative thinking that good code requires.

For debugging – when I'm hunting down elusive bugs, tracing through code line by line – I usually go instrumental. I need music that supports focus without adding mental complexity.

And for those late-night coding sessions when I'm in the zone, when hours pass without me noticing – that's when I put on my "flow state" playlist. A mix of everything, carefully curated to maintain energy without jarring transitions.

The funny thing is, I've started to associate certain songs with certain projects. When I hear that one Raftaar track, I remember the night I finally got my portfolio's navigation working properly. When I hear that lo-fi beat, I think about the hours I spent learning React hooks.

Music becomes part of the memory of creation.

But it's not just about the coding itself. Music also helps me manage the emotional ups and downs of programming.

When I'm frustrated because something isn't working, when I've been staring at the same error message for an hour, when I'm starting to doubt whether I'm cut out for this – that's when I put on something motivational. Something that reminds me why I love building things, why I started coding in the first place.

When I finally solve a difficult problem, when I see my code working perfectly, when I build something I'm proud of – that's when I celebrate with music that matches the victory. Something triumphant, something that acknowledges the accomplishment.

Music becomes the soundtrack to the emotional journey of creation.

I think this is why I listen to music most of the time during the day, not just while coding. I don't like noise – random sounds, conversations I'm not part of, the chaos of everyday life. But music isn't noise to me. Music is organized sound, intentional rhythm, emotional expression.

It's like having a constant companion that understands my mood and supports whatever I'm trying to do.

My friends sometimes ask me how I can concentrate with music playing. "Doesn't it distract you?" they say. "Don't the lyrics interfere with your thinking?"

But they're thinking about it wrong. The music isn't competing with my thoughts – it's harmonizing with them. The right song doesn't distract from my focus – it amplifies it.

It's like the difference between trying to think in a noisy restaurant versus thinking while walking in nature. Both have sound, but one is chaotic and distracting while the other is rhythmic and supportive.

Good coding music is like walking in nature for your brain.

I've also noticed that my music taste has evolved as I've gotten better at coding. In the beginning, I needed simpler music because my brain was working so hard to understand basic concepts. Now that I'm more comfortable with programming fundamentals, I can handle more complex music while coding.

It's like my brain has developed the capacity to process multiple streams of information simultaneously – the logical stream of code and the emotional stream of music – without them interfering with each other.

Sometimes I wonder if this is why I'm drawn to both coding and music production. They're both about creating patterns, about building something complex from simple elements, about finding the right rhythm and flow.

Maybe that's why music and coding work so well together for me. They're not separate activities – they're different expressions of the same creative impulse.

When I'm coding to the right music, I'm not just writing functions. I'm composing. I'm creating something that has both logical structure and emotional resonance.

And just like a good song, good code has rhythm, has flow, has moments of tension and release.

Music doesn't distract from my coding. Music is part of my coding.

*Coded to the beat, built with rhythm.*
