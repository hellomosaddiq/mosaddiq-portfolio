# Started coding on mobile with just a textbook

*August 5, 2024*

Two years ago, I had no laptop, no desktop, no fancy coding setup. Just a phone and a borrowed JavaScript textbook that someone had given up on.

Most people would say that's not enough to learn programming. Most coding tutorials assume you have a proper computer, a good keyboard, multiple monitors, all the tools that make development comfortable and efficient.

But I've learned that limitations often force the best kind of learning.

I remember the first time I tried to write JavaScript code on my phone. The screen was tiny, typing was slow and awkward, I couldn't run the code to see if it worked. I had to write everything in a notes app, then try to understand what it would do just by reading it.

It was frustrating. It was inefficient. It was probably the best thing that could have happened to my programming education.

When you can't just copy-paste code from Stack Overflow, when you can't quickly test every idea, when you have to think through each line carefully before typing it – you develop a different relationship with code.

You start to really understand what each line does, because you can't afford to write code you don't understand. You develop mental models of how programs work, because you can't rely on trial-and-error debugging. You learn to think before you code, because coding itself is so laborious.

That JavaScript textbook became my bible. I read every chapter multiple times, worked through every example by hand, made sure I understood every concept before moving on. Not because I was particularly disciplined, but because I had no other choice.

When other people were watching YouTube tutorials and coding along, I was reading about functions and trying to visualize how they would execute. When other people were building projects in their IDEs, I was writing pseudocode in my notes app and tracing through it mentally.

It was like learning to drive by studying the manual instead of getting behind the wheel. Slower, more theoretical, but also more thorough.

The funny thing is, when I finally got access to a proper computer months later, coding felt almost easy. All those concepts I had struggled to understand in theory suddenly made perfect sense in practice. The mental models I had built from reading and thinking translated directly into working code.

I realized that my phone-and-textbook period hadn't been a limitation – it had been a foundation.

This experience taught me something important about learning: constraints can be more valuable than resources.

When you have every tool available, it's easy to become dependent on those tools. You learn to code with autocomplete, with syntax highlighting, with instant error detection. These are all helpful, but they can also become crutches.

When you learn with constraints, you develop the underlying skills that make you effective regardless of your tools. You learn to think clearly about logic, to understand syntax deeply, to debug problems systematically.

I see this difference when I talk to other people who are learning to code. Some of them have amazing setups – multiple monitors, mechanical keyboards, every possible extension and tool. But they struggle when they encounter a problem their tools can't solve automatically.

Meanwhile, I'm comfortable coding in any environment because I learned to code in the most constrained environment possible.

This principle extends beyond coding. Some of my best paintings were created with a basic watercolor set and cheap paper. Some of my most productive study sessions happen when I have nothing but a textbook and a notebook.

When you don't have access to every possible resource, you learn to make the most of what you have. You develop resourcefulness, creativity, the ability to find solutions with limited tools.

I think this is especially valuable for someone from a small city like Dhubri. We don't have access to the same resources as people in big cities. We don't have coding bootcamps, tech meetups, mentorship programs, internship opportunities.

But we have something else: the necessity to figure things out on our own. And that necessity builds skills that no amount of resources can provide.

When I finally started building real projects, when I got access to proper development tools, when I could run code and see immediate results – it felt like superpowers. But the foundation was already there, built during those months of reading and thinking and understanding.

Now, when I'm working on complex projects, when I encounter bugs that my tools can't solve, when I need to understand how something works at a fundamental level – I draw on those skills I developed during my phone-and-textbook period.

I can read code and understand what it does without running it. I can debug problems by thinking through the logic systematically. I can learn new technologies by reading documentation carefully rather than just following tutorials.

These aren't flashy skills. They don't make for impressive demo videos or social media posts. But they're the skills that make you effective in the long term, that help you solve problems that don't have obvious solutions.

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had started with a perfect setup, with all the tools and resources I wanted. Would I have learned as deeply? Would I have developed the same problem-solving skills? Would I have the same appreciation for the fundamentals?

I don't think so.

Starting with limitations forced me to focus on what really matters in programming: understanding how computers think, how to break down problems logically, how to express solutions clearly.

Everything else – the tools, the frameworks, the fancy development environments – those are just ways to implement that understanding more efficiently.

This experience has shaped how I approach learning in general. When I encounter a new subject, I don't immediately look for the easiest path or the best tools. I try to understand the fundamentals first, even if it's harder, even if it takes longer.

When I'm studying for JEE, I don't just memorize formulas – I try to understand the underlying principles. When I'm learning a new programming language, I don't just follow tutorials – I read the documentation and understand how the language actually works.

It's slower, but it's more solid. It's harder, but it's more lasting.

Looking back, I'm grateful for those months of coding on my phone with just a textbook. Not because I enjoyed the limitations, but because they taught me that you don't need perfect conditions to start learning something important.

You just need curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to work with what you have.

Sometimes the best resources are the ones that force you to think harder, not the ones that make everything easier.
