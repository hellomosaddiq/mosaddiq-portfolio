# I don't like talking to people, but I love creating things

*May 5, 2025*

This might sound weird, but I've always been more comfortable expressing myself through things I make rather than things I say.

Put me in a room full of people, and I'll probably find a corner to stand in. Ask me to give a presentation, and I'll spend days anxiously preparing. Try to make small talk with me, and you'll get awkward silences and one-word answers.

But give me a blank canvas, a code editor, or a problem to solve, and suddenly I have so much to say.

I think I realized this about myself around Class 8 or 9. There was this school project where we had to present something about environmental conservation. Most kids prepared PowerPoint presentations or speeches. I painted a series of watercolors showing the same landscape across different seasons, with the last one showing it polluted and destroyed.

I barely said ten words during my presentation. Just showed the paintings and let them speak for themselves. But afterwards, teachers and classmates kept coming up to me, asking about the technique, the message, the emotions behind each painting.

That's when I understood: I might not be good at talking, but I'm pretty good at communicating through creation.

It's not that I don't have things to say. My mind is constantly full of thoughts, observations, ideas, opinions. But somehow, when I try to verbalize them in social situations, they get stuck. The words don't come out right, or they come out in the wrong order, or they don't capture what I actually meant.

But when I'm coding, when I'm painting, when I'm building something – the ideas flow freely. My hands know how to express what my mouth struggles with.

Take this portfolio I'm working on. Every design choice, every line of code, every word I write – it's all me trying to communicate who I am. The minimalistic design reflects my preference for simplicity and clarity. The way I organize information shows how my brain processes things. The color scheme reveals my aesthetic preferences.

Someone could learn more about my personality from exploring this website than from having a conversation with me.

And that's not because I'm trying to hide anything or because I'm antisocial. It's just that creation feels like a more natural language for me than conversation.

When I'm painting, I don't have to worry about whether I'm talking too much or too little. I don't have to read social cues or figure out the right thing to say. I can just focus on translating the image in my mind onto the canvas.

When I'm coding, I don't have to make small talk or pretend to be interested in topics that bore me. I can dive deep into problems that actually fascinate me, work at my own pace, think through solutions without interruption.

This preference for creation over conversation has shaped my entire approach to learning and self-expression.

In school, I was never the kid who asked questions in class or participated in discussions. But I was always the one who would go home and research topics that interested me, build projects related to what we were learning, find creative ways to demonstrate understanding.

My teachers used to think I was shy or disengaged. But really, I was just processing information differently. While other students were thinking out loud, I was thinking internally. While they were learning through discussion, I was learning through experimentation.

Even now, with JEE preparation, I've found that I learn better through solving problems than through listening to lectures. The 7-8 hours of classes are necessary, but the real learning happens during my solo study sessions, when I can work through concepts at my own pace, make my own connections, build my own understanding.

I think this is why I'm drawn to fields like engineering and programming. They reward deep thinking over quick talking. They value what you can build over how well you can network. They're meritocratic in a way that social situations often aren't.

In coding, it doesn't matter if you're introverted or extroverted, if you're good at small talk or terrible at presentations. What matters is whether your code works, whether your solutions are elegant, whether you can solve problems creatively.

The same is true for engineering. The bridge either stands or it falls. The circuit either works or it doesn't. The design either solves the problem or it doesn't. Your personality might affect how you work with teams, but ultimately, you're judged by what you create.

This is incredibly liberating for someone like me.

I don't have to pretend to be more social than I am. I don't have to force myself to enjoy networking events or group projects. I can focus on developing my skills, building my portfolio, creating things that demonstrate my capabilities.

And here's what I've discovered: when you create things that are genuinely good, people come to you. They want to know how you built that website, how you solved that problem, how you achieved that effect in your painting.

Suddenly, you're not struggling to make conversation – you're sharing your passion. You're not trying to think of things to say – you're explaining things you genuinely care about.

Some of my best conversations have happened when someone asked me about a project I was working on. Because then I'm not making small talk – I'm talking about something that matters to me, something I understand deeply, something I can explain with genuine enthusiasm.

I think this is why I connect so well with J., even though we've never met in person. Our conversations happen through text, which gives me time to think, to express myself clearly, to communicate without the pressure of real-time social interaction.

And when I do share my thoughts – like in these writings – it's because I've had time to process them, to organize them, to express them in a way that feels authentic.

I used to think there was something wrong with preferring creation over conversation. I thought I should try harder to be more social, more outgoing, more like the people who seem to effortlessly navigate social situations.

But I've come to realize that introversion isn't a flaw to be fixed – it's just a different way of engaging with the world. And for people like me, creation is our form of communication.

Every painting I finish, every website I build, every problem I solve – it's me saying something to the world. It's me contributing, participating, expressing myself in the language I speak most fluently.

And honestly? I think the world needs both kinds of people. We need the talkers and the creators, the networkers and the builders, the people who think out loud and the people who think in code.

I'm proud to be one of the creators.

*Built with intention, shared with purpose.*
