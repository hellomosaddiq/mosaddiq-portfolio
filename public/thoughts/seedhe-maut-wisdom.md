# Pehle khud aage badho, uske baad sabko aage badhao

*April 15, 2025*

There's this line from Seedhe Maut that's been stuck in my head for months: "Pehle khud aage badho, uske baad sabko aage badhao." First, move yourself forward, then help everyone else move forward.

It sounds simple, but it's probably the most profound piece of advice I've ever heard.

I discovered Seedhe Maut during one of those late-night YouTube rabbit holes. I was supposed to be studying, but my brain was fried from a particularly brutal chemistry session, so I decided to listen to some music to reset. One song led to another, and suddenly I was listening to this duo from Delhi rapping about struggle, ambition, and the grind of trying to make it.

But it wasn't just the beats or the flow that caught my attention. It was the philosophy behind their lyrics. They weren't just talking about getting rich or famous. They were talking about growth, about responsibility, about the balance between personal ambition and social consciousness.

"Pehle khud aage badho, uske baad sabko aage badhao."

The more I thought about this line, the more it made sense, especially in the context of my current situation.

Right now, I'm in the middle of my second JEE attempt. I'm spending 12+ hours a day studying, coding in whatever free time I have, trying to build skills and knowledge that will help me create the life I want. To some people, this might seem selfish. "Why are you so focused on yourself? Why aren't you helping others? Why aren't you more involved in social causes?"

But here's what I've realized: I can't help anyone else if I haven't figured out how to help myself first.

If I don't crack JEE, if I don't get into a good college, if I don't develop the skills I need to build a successful career – what exactly am I going to offer to others? Good intentions? Moral support? That's not enough.

The world doesn't need more people with good intentions who lack the capability to act on those intentions. The world needs people who have developed themselves to the point where they can actually make a difference.

This doesn't mean being selfish or ignoring the problems around you. It means being strategic about how you can have the maximum positive impact over the long term.

Right now, the best thing I can do for my family, my community, and society in general is to focus intensely on my own development. To crack JEE, get into a good college, develop technical skills, build a successful career. Not because I want to hoard wealth or status, but because that's how I'll be in a position to actually help others.

Think about it: if I become a successful engineer or entrepreneur, I can create jobs for people from my hometown. I can mentor other kids from small cities who are trying to make it in tech. I can contribute to projects that solve real problems. I can be the example that shows other people from Dhubri that big dreams are achievable.

But if I don't invest in myself first, if I don't build the foundation of knowledge and skills and experience that I need, then I'll just be another person with good intentions and limited capability.

This philosophy has helped me deal with the guilt I sometimes feel about being so focused on my own goals. There are days when I see problems in my community, in my country, in the world, and I think, "I should be doing something about this instead of just studying for JEE."

But then I remember: the most impactful thing I can do right now is to become the person who will be capable of addressing these problems effectively in the future.

It's like the airplane safety instruction: put on your own oxygen mask before helping others. You can't help anyone if you're unconscious.

This mindset has also changed how I think about success and ambition. I used to feel like wanting to achieve big things was somehow selfish or materialistic. But now I see ambition as a form of responsibility.

If I have the potential to become an engineer who builds useful technology, then it's my responsibility to develop that potential. If I have the ability to create businesses that employ people and solve problems, then it's my responsibility to build those skills.

Not pursuing your potential isn't humble – it's wasteful.

Of course, this philosophy requires balance. "Pehle khud aage badho" doesn't mean "only think about yourself forever." It means "develop yourself to the point where you can effectively help others."

The key is remembering the second part: "uske baad sabko aage badhao." Once you've moved yourself forward, help everyone else move forward too.

I think about successful people I admire – entrepreneurs who create jobs, engineers who build useful technology, artists who inspire others, teachers who share knowledge. What they all have in common is that they first invested heavily in developing themselves, and then used their capabilities to benefit others.

They didn't try to help everyone from day one when they had nothing to offer. They focused on building their skills, their knowledge, their resources, their platform. And then, from that position of strength, they were able to make a real difference.

This is the path I'm trying to follow. Right now, I'm in the "pehle khud aage badho" phase. I'm studying intensively, learning to code, developing skills, building knowledge, preparing for the opportunities that will come.

But I haven't forgotten the second part. I'm already thinking about how I can use whatever success I achieve to help others. I want to mentor other students from small cities. I want to build technology that solves real problems. I want to create opportunities for people who come from backgrounds similar to mine.

The difference is that now I'm approaching these goals strategically rather than emotionally. Instead of trying to help everyone right now with limited resources and capabilities, I'm building the foundation that will allow me to help people effectively in the future.

Some people might call this delayed gratification. I call it intelligent compassion.

The world has enough people who want to help but lack the capability to do so effectively. What the world needs is more people who are willing to invest in developing their capabilities so that their desire to help can actually translate into meaningful impact.

"Pehle khud aage badho, uske baad sabko aage badhao."

First, become the person you need to be. Then, help others become the people they need to be.

That's not selfish. That's strategic. And in the long run, it's the most generous thing you can do.

*Building the foundation, keeping the vision.*
