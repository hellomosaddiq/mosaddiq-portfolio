# Building from scratch feels like creating your own world

*April 25, 2025*

There's something magical that happens when you start with a blank file and end up with something that works. Something that didn't exist before, but now does because you made it exist.

I discovered this feeling two years ago when I first started coding. Back then, I only had my phone and a JavaScript textbook I'd borrowed from someone. No fancy setup, no multiple monitors, no Stack Overflow to copy-paste from. Just me, a small screen, and the determination to understand how websites actually work.

The first time I made a button change color when I clicked it, I felt like I had discovered magic. It was such a simple thing – probably took me three hours to figure out because I was learning everything from scratch – but in that moment, I realized I had the power to create things that didn't exist before.

That feeling has only gotten stronger over the past two years.

Every time I start a new project, whether it's a simple portfolio website or a more complex web app, I get this rush of excitement. It's like standing in front of a blank canvas, except instead of paint, I have code. Instead of brushes, I have logic and creativity.

The best part about building from scratch is that you're not just following someone else's tutorial or copying someone else's design. You're making decisions. You're solving problems that are uniquely yours. You're creating something that reflects your personality, your way of thinking, your aesthetic preferences.

Take this portfolio I'm working on right now. I could have used a template, could have copied someone else's design, could have taken the easy route. But where's the fun in that? Instead, I'm building it piece by piece, making every decision deliberately.

Why this color scheme? Because I like minimalistic designs that don't hurt your eyes during late-night coding sessions. Why this navigation structure? Because I want visitors to easily find what they're looking for without getting overwhelmed. Why this particular way of organizing my thoughts? Because it reflects how my brain actually works.

Building from scratch means every line of code has a purpose. Every design choice has a reason. Every feature exists because I decided it should exist, not because it was already there in a template.

But it's not just about the technical aspect. Building from scratch is therapeutic for me, especially during these intense JEE prep months.

When I'm frustrated with a physics problem that won't make sense, when I'm tired of memorizing chemistry reactions, when math feels like an insurmountable mountain – I can switch to coding and suddenly I'm in control again. I can create solutions instead of just trying to understand problems someone else created.

There's something deeply satisfying about the logical nature of code. If something doesn't work, there's a reason. If you fix the reason, it works. Unlike JEE preparation, where sometimes you can understand a concept perfectly but still get the question wrong because of some tiny detail you missed.

In coding, when you build something from scratch, you understand every part of it. You know why each function exists, what each variable does, how each component connects to the others. It's like building a house where you personally laid every brick, installed every wire, painted every wall.

And when someone uses what you've built, when they navigate through your website or interact with your app, they're experiencing your creation. They're walking through a world you built from nothing.

I think this is why I'm drawn to minimalistic designs like Linear or Claude AI. They feel intentional. Every element serves a purpose. Nothing is there just for decoration. It's clear that someone made deliberate choices about every aspect of the design.

That's what I want my code to feel like. Intentional. Purposeful. Clean.

Sometimes I wonder if this love for building from scratch will conflict with my engineering studies if I get into IIT Delhi. Will I have time to code? Will I still feel this excitement about creating things?

But then I realize that engineering is also about building from scratch. It's about taking raw materials – whether that's code, metal, ideas, or mathematical concepts – and turning them into something useful, something beautiful, something that didn't exist before.

Maybe that's why I'm so drawn to both coding and engineering. They're both about creation. They're both about taking nothing and making it something.

Right now, as I'm building this portfolio, I'm not just creating a website. I'm creating a representation of who I am, what I can do, how I think. I'm building a world that visitors can explore to understand me better.

And every time I add a new feature, fix a bug, or improve the design, I'm reminded of why I fell in love with coding in the first place. It's not just about the technology. It's about the power to create, to build, to bring ideas to life.

In a world where so much feels out of my control – JEE results, college admissions, future uncertainties – coding gives me a space where I am completely in control. Where I can build exactly what I envision, where I can create my own world from scratch.

And that feeling? That's addictive.
