# Math used to be my favorite, now it's my biggest enemy

*June 10, 2025*

I used to love math. Like, genuinely love it.

In Class 9 and 10, I was that kid who would finish the math exam first and still get the highest marks. Algebra felt like solving puzzles. Geometry was like drawing with logic. Trigonometry was this beautiful dance of angles and ratios that just made sense.

I remember my Class 10 math teacher, Mrs. Sharma, telling my parents during a parent-teacher meeting, "Hazrat has a natural aptitude for mathematics. He should definitely pursue engineering." I felt so proud hearing that. Math wasn't just a subject for me – it was my superpower.

Then Class 11 happened.

Suddenly, math wasn't about finding the value of x or calculating the area of a triangle. It was about limits and derivatives and integration and complex numbers and vectors and 3D geometry and probability and statistics all thrown at you at once.

The worst part? Everyone kept saying, "If you're good at math, JEE math will be easy for you." But JEE math isn't just math. It's math on steroids, math with a time limit, math designed to trick you, math that assumes you've memorized not just the formulas but also the 47 different ways each formula can be twisted.

I'll never forget the first time I attempted a JEE math paper in Class 11. I was confident going in – after all, I was the "math guy." Two hours later, I walked out having attempted maybe 8 questions out of 30, and I was pretty sure I'd gotten most of those wrong too.

That night, I sat in my room staring at the question paper, trying to figure out what had gone wrong. These weren't impossible questions. Other students were solving them. But somehow, the math that used to feel like my friend had become this intimidating stranger.

The problem wasn't that I didn't understand the concepts. I could explain calculus, I could derive formulas, I could solve textbook problems. But JEE math requires a different kind of thinking. It requires you to see patterns instantly, to recognize which method to use within seconds, to avoid the traps that the question setters have carefully laid out.

It's like the difference between knowing how to drive and knowing how to race in Formula 1. Same basic skill, completely different level of execution.

Over the past two years, my relationship with math has become... complicated.

Some days, I solve a particularly challenging problem and feel that old spark of joy. The satisfaction of working through a complex integration or nailing a coordinate geometry problem – it's still there. Those moments remind me why I fell in love with math in the first place.

But other days, I sit with a math problem for an hour and get nowhere. I try method after method, formula after formula, and nothing works. Then I check the solution and realize I was supposed to use some obscure property or technique that I either forgot or never learned properly.

Those are the days when math feels like my enemy.

The worst part is the time pressure. In a classroom setting, I can eventually solve most problems if you give me enough time. But in JEE, you have roughly 1.5 minutes per question. That's not enough time to think through multiple approaches or double-check your work. You need to see the solution path immediately, execute it flawlessly, and move on.

And here's what really gets to me: math is supposed to be logical. It's supposed to be fair. If you understand the concept and apply it correctly, you should get the right answer. But JEE math often feels like it's testing your ability to spot tricks rather than your mathematical understanding.

I've started to realize that my struggle with math isn't really about math itself. It's about adapting to a completely different way of thinking about math.

In school, math problems were straightforward. They tested whether you understood the concept. In JEE, math problems are puzzles. They test whether you can think creatively under pressure, whether you can spot the elegant solution among multiple possible approaches, whether you can avoid the mental traps.

It's taken me almost two years to accept that being good at school math doesn't automatically make you good at JEE math. They're related skills, but they're not the same skill.

Now, in my second attempt, I'm trying to rebuild my relationship with math from scratch. Instead of relying on my old confidence, I'm approaching it like a beginner. I'm practicing pattern recognition. I'm memorizing not just formulas but also the contexts in which they're typically used. I'm learning to think like a JEE question setter.

Some days, it feels like I'm making progress. I'll solve a problem that would have stumped me six months ago, or I'll recognize a pattern I've seen before. Those small victories keep me going.

But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't frustrating. There's something deeply unsettling about having your strongest subject become your weakest. It's like discovering that your best friend has been talking behind your back for years.

My physics and chemistry scores have been steadily improving over the past few months. But math? Math remains stubborn. Some days I love it, some days I hate it, but most days I just feel confused by it.

I know I need to make peace with math if I want to crack JEE. I know that underneath all the tricks and time pressure, it's still the same beautiful, logical subject I fell in love with in Class 10.

But right now, we're in couples therapy, math and I. Trying to figure out how to work together again. Trying to remember what we liked about each other in the first place.

I'm hopeful we'll get there. After all, we have history together. And despite everything, on my best days, when I solve a really elegant problem, I still feel that old spark.

Maybe that's enough to build on.

*Still working on it, one problem at a time.*
