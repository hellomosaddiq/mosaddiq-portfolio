# Why I love minimalistic design like Linear and Claude

*February 15, 2025*

There's something deeply satisfying about opening Linear or Claude AI and seeing nothing but clean lines, thoughtful spacing, and purposeful elements. No visual noise, no unnecessary decorations, no elements competing for attention. Just pure functionality wrapped in elegant simplicity.

I've been obsessed with minimalistic design for as long as I can remember, but I only recently understood why.

It started with my hatred of noise. Not just auditory noise – though I definitely prefer quiet environments – but visual noise, mental noise, any kind of chaos that makes it harder to focus on what actually matters.

When I look at a cluttered website, with multiple fonts, bright colors everywhere, pop-ups and banners and sidebars full of random information, I feel overwhelmed before I even start reading. My brain doesn't know where to look first, what's important, what I'm supposed to do.

But when I look at something like Linear's interface – clean typography, plenty of white space, clear hierarchy, every element serving a specific purpose – I feel calm. I can focus on the task at hand instead of fighting through visual clutter to find what I need.

This preference extends beyond digital design. My room is minimally decorated. My study space has only the essentials. Even my code tends to be clean and organized, with clear variable names and consistent formatting.

I think this comes from growing up in a small city where life is naturally simpler. In Dhubri, you don't have a thousand options for everything. You don't have visual overload everywhere you look. There's a natural simplicity to small-city life that I've come to appreciate more as I've gotten older.

But it's not just about aesthetics. Minimalistic design is about respect – respect for the user's time, attention, and intelligence.

When Linear shows me exactly what I need to see and nothing more, they're respecting my cognitive load. They're not trying to impress me with fancy animations or overwhelm me with features I don't need. They're helping me get my work done efficiently.

When Claude AI presents information in clean, readable text without unnecessary formatting or distracting elements, they're respecting my ability to focus on the content rather than the presentation.

This is the opposite of what most websites and apps do. Most digital products seem designed to grab attention rather than facilitate focus. They're optimized for engagement metrics rather than user experience.

But minimalistic design is optimized for something more valuable: clarity.

I've been trying to apply this philosophy to my own work. When I'm building websites, I constantly ask myself: "Does this element serve a purpose? Does it help the user accomplish their goal? Or is it just decoration?"

If it's just decoration, it gets removed.

This doesn't mean my designs are boring or lifeless. Minimalism isn't about removing all personality – it's about expressing personality through intentional choices rather than visual excess.

The color palette I choose, the typography I select, the spacing I use, the way I organize information – these are all expressions of my aesthetic preferences and design philosophy. But they're purposeful expressions, not random decorations.

I think this is why I'm drawn to companies like Linear, Stripe, and Anthropic. Their design choices reflect a deeper philosophy about how technology should work. They prioritize function over form, clarity over complexity, user needs over designer ego.

These companies understand that good design is invisible. When someone uses Linear to manage their projects, they're not thinking about the interface – they're thinking about their work. The design gets out of the way and lets them focus on what matters.

This is what I want my code to do too. I want people to use the websites I build and think about their goals, not about the website itself. I want the interface to be so intuitive, so clean, so purposeful that it becomes transparent.

Minimalistic design is also more sustainable, both technically and cognitively.

From a technical perspective, simpler designs load faster, require less maintenance, and are easier to update. There are fewer elements to break, fewer dependencies to manage, fewer things that can go wrong.

From a cognitive perspective, minimalistic interfaces reduce decision fatigue. When users aren't overwhelmed by choices and visual complexity, they can make decisions more quickly and confidently.

This matters especially for tools that people use frequently. If I'm going to spend hours every day in a project management tool or a code editor, I want it to feel calm and organized, not chaotic and overwhelming.

I think my preference for minimalistic design also reflects my personality. I'm someone who prefers depth over breadth, quality over quantity, intention over impulse.

I'd rather have a few close friends than a large social circle. I'd rather master a few skills deeply than dabble in many superficially. I'd rather build one thing really well than build many things poorly.

Minimalistic design embodies these same values. It's about doing fewer things, but doing them exceptionally well. It's about making deliberate choices rather than including everything possible.

This philosophy has influenced how I approach not just design, but coding in general. I prefer clean, readable code over clever tricks. I prefer simple solutions over complex ones. I prefer tools that do one thing well over tools that try to do everything.

Some people think minimalistic design is easy because there are fewer elements to work with. But actually, it's much harder. When you can't hide behind visual complexity, every choice becomes critical. Every element has to earn its place. Every detail has to be perfect.

It's like writing poetry versus writing prose. With prose, you can use many words to express an idea. With poetry, every word has to count. Minimalistic design is the poetry of user interfaces.

This is why I spend so much time studying companies like Linear and Claude. I'm not just looking at what they include – I'm studying what they choose to exclude. I'm trying to understand the principles behind their design decisions.

How do they decide what features to build? How do they organize information? How do they balance functionality with simplicity? How do they maintain clarity as they add complexity?

These are the questions that fascinate me, because they're not just about design – they're about philosophy. They're about how you think technology should serve people, how you prioritize user needs, how you make difficult trade-offs.

Minimalistic design isn't just an aesthetic choice. It's a statement about what you value, what you believe, how you want to impact the people who use what you build.

And for me, that statement is clear: I want to build things that respect people's time, attention, and intelligence. I want to create clarity in a world full of noise.

*Designed with intention, built with purpose.*
