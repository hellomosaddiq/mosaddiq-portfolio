# 7-8 hours of classes, then evening study, then night grind

*May 25, 2025*

Let me paint you a picture of what my life looks like right now.

6:00 AM - Alarm goes off. Hit snooze twice because I was up until 4 AM studying.

6:30 AM - Actually get up. Quick shower, grab whatever food is available, check phone for 5 minutes (usually a good morning text from J. that makes the early wake-up worth it).

7:00 AM - Classes begin. Physics first, usually. Sit in a room with 30 other kids who are all chasing the same dream, all carrying the same pressure.

For the next 7-8 hours, it's non-stop. Physics, Chemistry, Math, repeat. Short breaks where everyone either discusses the problems we just solved or stares at their phones in exhausted silence.

3:00 PM - Classes end. I'm mentally drained but the day is far from over.

3:30 PM - Lunch, finally. Sometimes I'm so focused during classes that I forget I'm hungry until this moment.

4:00 PM - Quick power nap if I'm lucky. If not, straight to evening study.

5:00 PM to 8:00 PM - Evening study session. This is when I review everything from the morning classes, do the homework, solve additional problems. My brain is tired but I push through because I know the night session is when the real magic happens.

8:00 PM - Dinner with family. The only time of day when I'm not thinking about JEE. We talk about random stuff, I tell them about my day, they tell me about theirs. It's normal. It's nice.

9:00 PM to 11:00 PM - Some downtime. Maybe I code a little bit, work on a small project. Or I paint if I'm feeling particularly stressed. Sometimes I just listen to music and chat with J. These two hours are my lifeline to sanity.

11:00 PM - Most people would go to sleep now. I get ready for round three.

11:30 PM to 2:00 AM - Light study. Review notes, solve a few problems, prepare for the next day.

2:00 AM onwards - The deep work begins. This is when I tackle the hardest problems, when I try to understand concepts that confused me during the day, when I push my limits.

This routine has been my life for months now. Seven days a week, with maybe Sunday afternoons off if I'm ahead on my study schedule (which rarely happens).

People ask me how I do it. "Isn't it exhausting?" "Don't you get burned out?" "When do you have fun?"

The truth is, yes, it's exhausting. Some days I wake up and the thought of another 12+ hour study day makes me want to crawl back under the covers. Some days I look at my friends' Instagram stories – them hanging out, going to movies, living normal college lives – and I wonder if I'm missing out on being 19.

But then I remember why I'm doing this.

Every problem I solve correctly, every concept that finally clicks, every mock test score that improves – it's proof that this routine is working. It's proof that I'm getting closer to my goal.

The thing about preparing for JEE on your second attempt is that you can't afford to be casual about it. You can't study for a few hours and hope for the best. You have to be obsessed. You have to make it your entire life, at least for these crucial months.

And honestly? There's something beautiful about having this level of focus. When your entire day is structured around one goal, when every hour has a purpose, when you can see yourself improving day by day – it's addictive.

My friends think I'm crazy. My family worries I'm pushing too hard. But I know something they don't: this isn't just about cracking JEE. This is about proving to myself that I can commit to something completely, that I can push through discomfort and exhaustion and doubt to achieve something that matters to me.

The routine is brutal, but it's also building me into someone I'm proud of. Someone who doesn't give up when things get hard. Someone who can delay gratification for a bigger goal. Someone who understands that extraordinary results require extraordinary effort.

Will I maintain this routine forever? Of course not. But right now, for these months, this is what it takes. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

Besides, I've learned to find joy in small moments within the routine. The satisfaction of solving a difficult problem. The quiet pride when a teacher nods approvingly at my answer. The peaceful feeling during my 2 AM study sessions when the world is asleep and I'm working toward my dreams.

This routine isn't just preparing me for JEE. It's preparing me for life.
