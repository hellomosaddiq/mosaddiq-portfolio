# Why I study better after 2 AM

*June 15, 2025*

People think I'm crazy when I tell them my best study sessions happen after 2 AM. "You should sleep early, wake up early," they say. "Morning is the best time for studying."

But they don't understand. They don't know what it's like to have a mind that won't shut up.

During the day, there's noise everywhere. Not just the literal noise – though living in Dhubri means there's always something happening outside, some uncle playing music too loud, some kid crying, some vehicle honking. But it's the mental noise that gets to me the most.

During the day, my brain is constantly jumping between thoughts. "Did I understand that chemistry concept properly?" "What if I don't crack JEE this time either?" "I should probably call J." "Maybe I should work on that coding project." "Am I wasting my time?" "What are my friends doing in college right now?"

It's exhausting.

But after 2 AM? The world changes.

The literal noise stops first. No more honking, no more people talking outside, no more distractions from the outside world. Dhubri goes to sleep, and suddenly it's just me and my books.

Then the mental noise starts to fade too. All those anxious thoughts, all that overthinking – it's like my brain finally gets tired of being chaotic and decides to focus. The physics problems that seemed impossible at 3 PM suddenly make perfect sense at 3 AM.

There's something magical about those hours between 2 AM and 5 AM. It's like the universe gives you this gift of complete silence, and your mind finally has the space to actually think instead of just worrying.

I remember one night last month, I was struggling with a particularly nasty calculus problem. I'd been staring at it for hours during the day, getting more and more frustrated. Finally gave up around 11 PM, watched some random YouTube videos, talked to J. for a bit.

Then at 2:30 AM, I couldn't sleep. So I went back to that problem. And within 20 minutes, I had it solved. Not just solved – I understood it. I could see the pattern, the logic, the beauty of it.

That's when I realized: my brain doesn't work like everyone else's.

During the day, I'm fighting against my natural rhythm. I'm trying to force focus when my mind wants to wander. But at night, especially those deep night hours, I'm working with my brain instead of against it.

My study routine now is built around this realization. I do my 7-8 hours of classes during the day because I have to. I do some evening study to review what I learned. But the real work, the deep understanding, the breakthrough moments – they happen after 2 AM.

Sometimes I put on some music – usually something without lyrics, maybe some lo-fi beats or instrumental hip-hop. The music doesn't distract me; it actually helps me focus. It's like it gives my brain just enough stimulation to stay alert without being overwhelming.

I know it's not conventional. I know it's not what the study guides recommend. But here's what I've learned in my 19 years: you have to work with who you are, not who you think you should be.

Some people are morning larks. I'm a night owl. Some people need complete silence. I need just the right amount of background noise. Some people study best in groups. I study best alone, in the quiet hours when the world is asleep and my mind is finally awake.

The only downside? Explaining to people why I'm not available for morning plans. "Sorry, I was up until 5 AM studying" sounds like an excuse, but it's just my reality.

But when I see my physics scores improving, when calculus problems start making sense, when I can feel myself actually understanding instead of just memorizing – I know I'm on the right track.

The world might run on 9-to-5 schedules, but my brain runs on 2-to-5 schedules. And that's okay.
