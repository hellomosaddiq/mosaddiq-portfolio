# When I paint, I forget everything - literally everything

*March 20, 2025*

I've been painting since I was 8 years old, but I only recently understood why it means so much to me.

It started as a way to pass time. My parents got me a basic watercolor set for my birthday, probably thinking it would keep me occupied for a few hours. They had no idea they were giving me a lifeline that would carry me through the next 11 years.

Back then, I painted simple things. Houses with triangular roofs, stick figure families, trees that looked more like green clouds on brown sticks. Nothing special, nothing that would win any awards. But even then, I noticed something strange happening when I painted.

The world would disappear.

Not in a dramatic way. Not like in movies where everything goes black and white except for the thing you're focused on. It was more subtle than that. The noise in my head would gradually fade. The worries about school, about fitting in, about whether I was good enough at anything – they would just... stop.

For those few hours with a brush in my hand, I wasn't the kid who struggled with math homework or felt awkward talking to classmates. I wasn't worried about the future or embarrassed about the past. I was just... present. Completely, entirely present.

Now, at 19, in the middle of the most stressful period of my life, painting has become more than a hobby. It's become my sanctuary.

Yesterday was particularly brutal. I'd spent 8 hours in JEE classes, struggled through evening study, and was feeling completely overwhelmed by a chemistry chapter that just wouldn't make sense. My brain felt like it was running at 200% capacity with no relief in sight.

I was lying in bed around 10 PM, staring at the ceiling, when I saw my art supplies in the corner of my room. I hadn't touched them in two weeks because of the intense study schedule.

But something in me said, "Just for an hour. Just to reset."

I set up my easel, squeezed some colors onto my palette, and started painting. No plan, no reference image, no goal except to move the brush and see what happened.

Within minutes, the transformation began.

First, my breathing slowed down. The tight feeling in my chest – the one that's been there for months because of JEE stress – started to ease.

Then my mind stopped racing. All those thoughts that had been bouncing around my head like ping pong balls – "What if I don't crack JEE again?" "Am I wasting my time?" "What will people think if I fail?" – they just... quieted down.

By the time I was 30 minutes into the painting, I had entered what I can only describe as a different state of consciousness. I wasn't thinking about what I was painting. I wasn't planning the next brushstroke. I wasn't judging whether it was good or bad. I was just... flowing.

My hand moved the brush, the brush moved the paint, the paint created shapes and colors on the canvas. It was like meditation, except instead of focusing on my breath, I was focusing on the pure act of creation.

Time became irrelevant. I thought I'd been painting for maybe 45 minutes, but when I finally looked up, it was past midnight. Two hours had disappeared without me noticing.

And here's the most amazing part: when I finally put the brush down, I felt like a completely different person than the one who had picked it up. The stress was still there – JEE prep doesn't magically disappear – but it felt manageable again. My mind felt clear. My body felt relaxed.

I looked at what I had painted, and honestly, it wasn't my best work. The proportions were a bit off, the color mixing could have been better. But that didn't matter. The painting wasn't the point. The process was the point.

This is what people don't understand when they ask me about my hobbies. They think painting is just something I do for fun, like watching movies or playing games. But it's so much deeper than that.

Painting is how I reset my brain. It's how I process emotions I can't put into words. It's how I connect with a part of myself that gets buried under all the academic pressure and future planning and daily stress.

When I paint, I'm not Hazrat the JEE aspirant, or Mosaddiq the coder, or the guy from Dhubri trying to make it to IIT Delhi. I'm just... me. The most essential version of myself, stripped of all the labels and expectations and worries.

It's the only activity where I can be completely present without any effort. I don't have to try to focus – focus happens naturally. I don't have to try to stop overthinking – the overthinking just stops.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what meditation feels like for other people. This complete absorption in the present moment, this quieting of the mental chatter, this sense of being exactly where you're supposed to be.

I've tried traditional meditation, but my mind is too restless for it. I've tried other relaxation techniques, but they feel forced. Painting is the only thing that naturally brings me to this state of peace.

And the best part? The effects last. Even after I clean my brushes and put away my supplies, I carry that sense of calm with me. I sleep better. I wake up more refreshed. I approach my studies with a clearer mind.

My parents sometimes worry that I'm "wasting time" painting when I should be studying. But they don't understand that painting doesn't take away from my studies – it makes my studies possible.

Without those hours of complete mental reset, I would have burned out months ago. Without that sanctuary where I can just be myself, the pressure of JEE prep would have crushed me.

Painting reminds me that I'm more than my academic performance. I'm more than my future plans. I'm more than my worries and ambitions.

I'm a person who can create beauty from nothing. I'm a person who can find peace in chaos. I'm a person who has this incredible ability to completely lose himself in the act of creation.

And sometimes, that's all I need to remember.

*Painted with peace, from my corner of the world.*
